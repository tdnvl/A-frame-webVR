            <h2><a href="primitives-and-attributes.html">Primitives and attributes</a></h2>
            <p>The <code>side</code> attribute helps make a shape visible from <em>both</em> sides</p>
            <p><code>open-ended</code> opens the volume, making it look hollow</p>

            <p>Distances are in meter!</p>
            <p>The 3D space is a right-hand XYZ with positive Z pointing towards the user</p>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption">3D space in A-Frame.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If surfaces overlap, the rendering will bug. Make sure that there is 1 cm of difference in X, Y, or Z to
                avoid this effect.</p>
            <p>Children entities inherit position from parent entities. This is a very convenient way of "grouping"
                entities that one wants to move together.</p>
            <h2><a href="rotation-and-relative-rotation.html">Rotation and relative rotation</a></h2>
            <p>Each entity has the rotation component, just like the rotation component, and it is represented by an
                html attribute: <code>rotation</code>.</p>
            <p>Just like position, the children inherit rotation, too. The direction of rotation is found using the
                right hand rule again: Wrap your right hand around the axis in question, with the thumb poiting towards
                increasing values. The way your fingers wrap around the axis indicate the positive rotatin direction.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="scale-relative-scale-reflection.html">Scale, relative scale, and reflection</a></h2>
            <p>Scale is tricky: Be careful if you apply a rotation to the entity! The axes will rotate, too, and you'll
                have to really use the right hand rule to visualize where the scaling should be applied.</p>
            <p>Negative scaling is called <em>reflection</em>, and it's basically like pulling a sock inside out. Using
                <code>side="double"</code> will help keep the entity looking "solid."</p>
            <h2><a href="image-textures-and-materials.html">Image textures and materials</a></h2>
            <p>Adding a texture to an entity is as simple as pointing to an image in an <code>src</code> attribute. The
                textures in this course were sourced for free from textures.com.</p>
            <p>Note that if the entity already has a color, the color will be seen through the texture. We can either
                remove the color attribute or change it to white.</p>
            <p>A <code>repeat</code> attribute acts a bit like the background repeate in CSS. We can decide how many
                time a texture is repeated on the x and y axes. The default is <code>repeat="1 1"</code></p>
            <h3>Normal maps</h3>
            <p>From the Unity documentation:</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">Normal maps are a type of Bump Map. They are a special kind of texture that
                allow you to add
                surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are
                represented by real geometry.</blockquote>
            <h3>Asset Management System</h3>
            <p>By using <code>a-assets</code> we can preload assets in A-Frame and call them in the scene when we need
                them. In the entity,
                use: <code>normal-map="#texture-id"</code>. Other normal maps attributes include:
                <code>normal-texture-repeat</code> which defaults a 1 1 and acts like the texture repeat.</p>
            <p>The normal map can be scaled (default 1 1). Inverting the scale on an axis (-1) can fix the lighting
                direction issues and make a texture look much better.</p>
            <p><code>roughness="0.5"</code> by default; makes the texture look shinier (<0.5) or duller (>0.5).</p>
            <p>The material component can be used to do the same thing as for the first box. It feels a bit like CSS.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="image-and-curved-image-primitives.html">Image and curved image primitives</a></h2>
            <p>With <code>a-image</code> we can use a conversion of 1 pixel per mm.</p>
            <p>There's a trick to scale images without any loss:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make the width one meter (1)</li>
                <li>Calculate the height by calculating the distance in m per pixel (width in m / width in px)</li>
                <li>Multiply by this ratio by the height in px to get the height in m</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So (1 m/1024 px)*768 px = 0.75 m. To make the image larger without distorsion, we can simply increase the
                scale: <code>3 3 1</code></p>
            <h3>Curved image primitive</h3>
            <p>The <code>theta-length</code> attribute is the "length" of the curve, expressed as an angle (default
                270).
                The <code>theta-start</code> attribute is the angle at which the curve starts (couter clockwise angle)
            </p>
            <p>To calculate the width of a curved image, we need to rely on <a
                    href="http://handymath.com/cgi-bin/arc18.cgi?submit=Entry" target="_blank">an arc calculator.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Curved images are appealing because <em>they are easier on the eyes</em> than rectangles. There is less
                distorsion.</p>
            <h2>Breaking primitives down</h2>
            <p><code>
                    <a-entity></a-entity>
                </code> has no appearance, behavior, or functionality. It's like and empty div.</p>
            <p>Primitives are entities with a semantic name that have a preset bundle of components with default values
                and map HTML attributes to component data.</p>
